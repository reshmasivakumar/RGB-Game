# The RGB Color Guessing Game 
*[HTML, CSS, Styling, JavaScript, Dom Manipulation and Event Handling]*

The game displays 6 squares of random different colors and also displays the color in RGB. The point of the game is to pick the correct color. If the player chooses the wrong color, that square disappears and also leaves a message “Try Again”. If the player chooses the correct color, all the 6 squares appear and changes to that correct color. It also displays a message “correct” and leaves the user with the choice to play again.
